Group Project for web dev class

In my version, enter the name and amount to update the database and display the cumulative result.

Integration of Database complete. Code is using XAMPP with testuser/mypassword. The database name is checkdata. The table is checkdatatable, and the column values are reciever and checkAmount. Welcome.php is the page you should bring up with your browser.

The only problem with the code is that when data is submitted to database, the web page refreshes and the array of images starts over. I may be able to find a solution tomorrow. Other than that we can maybe add some more CSS and any other little things we want.
